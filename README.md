big-data-studies
================

Experimental algorithms that I'm developing during my Big Data studies, initially for hadoop.
Currently, I'm trying to analyse data from Brazilian Government program called [Bolsa Família](http://www.mds.gov.br/bolsafamilia). The data used for this is available at [Portal da Transparência](http://www.portaltransparencia.gov.br/) from Brazilian Government, and can be found [here](http://www.portaltransparencia.gov.br/downloads/view.asp?c=BolsaFamiliaFolhaPagamento).
This is only a work with data, aiming to learn more about big data strategies, techniques, technology and concepts. I don't have the intent of taking conclusions based on the results of data analysis.
